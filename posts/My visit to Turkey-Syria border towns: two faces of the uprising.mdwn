_Note: this is an alpha pre-release of this article, awaiting reviews, corrections and improvements (notably pictures and maps)._

I wandered around the Turkey-Syria border during the first week of February, 2013. I went to the Kurdish border town of [Nusaybin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nusaybin), facing very closely its Syrian counterpart, [Qamishly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qamishli). I went shortly after to [Kilis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilis), a Turkish town near Syria's border crossing [Bab Assalameh](http://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=36.632911&mlon=37.0844364&zoom=15&layers=M) (also written Bab al-Salameh) in Aleppo's region, into which I briefly entered.

Those two places are two worlds where the Syrian revolution has completely different faces. I am trying here to compare what I saw and heard in those places, as it might help a bit in understanding what is going on.

# Kilis-Bab Assalameh: fights, destructions and massive displacements

## Heavy Syrian presence in Turkey's Kilis and Gaziantep

Kilis and Gaziantep have an obvious presence of Syrians displaced because of the conflict. Some have settled months or weeks ago, others spend the day before going back to Syria with food or goods. Hundreds of Syrian cars circulate on the main road between the border and Gaziantep. There is a very noticeable Syrian daily life in Kilis, which seemed to me seeminglessly integrated with the locals, most of them speaking Arabic. Syrians in Kilis seem mostly opposed to the regime, some caf√©s displaying the flag of the revolution.

Housing prices have reportedly increased significantly in Kilis, as Turkish landlords raise prices because incoming Syrians increase the demand.

## Open border crossing between Kilis and FSA-controlled Bab Assalameh

Kilis-Bab Assalameh border crossing is busy all day long with non-stop flows of Syrian civilians going in and out, trucks delivering goods to Syria, wounded civilians or fighters transferred to Turkey, journalists, relief organization volunteers and so on. Normal rules seem to apply on Turkish side, implying that Syrians with a valid passport can come freely in an out of Turkey. Those who don't can try to sneak in but can be arrested and sent back by the Turkish army. Crossing with a car requires documents and/or payment of a tax to Turkish authorities, so many Syrians park on the Syrian side and cross by foot.

Bab Assalameh is run by the Free Syrian Army (FSA). A small number of gunmen try to keep it somewhat organized, mostly by overseeing the traffic and checking vehicles' content. There is a press office to which foreign journalists (professional or not) must make themselves known upon arrival.

[[!img images/P1130673.jpg alt="Welcome to Syria..." caption="Welcome to Syria..."]] [[!img images/P1130685_up.jpg alt="Trying to make it look organized" caption="Trying to make it look organized"]]

I saw dozens, if not hundreds, of trucks going to Syria. I was told that tons of food and goods are delivered by Turkish authorities to northern Syria, but I do not know exactly how they are dispatched. I saw a truck full of flour sent by the Turks, and a truck full of new mattresses. A truck carrying drinking water tanks for the refugees was parked in the camp.

I've been told that international law forbids delivering goods to civilians for foreign countries, excepted for neighbor countries. Consequently, the help that officially reaches northern Syria exclusively relies on Turkish government via their relief orgnanization [IHH](http://www.ihh.org.tr/) and on importations made by Syrians themselves.

I witnessed a transfer of an injured person at the border crossing: brougth by a Syrian van used as an ambulance, the person was transfered to a Turkish ambulance to be treated at the Kilis hospital. Turkish authorities allow wounded Syrians into Turkey depending on how seriously they are wounded. I heard that someone shot himself in the hand to be granted entry into Turkey for himself and his family. I also saw a Swedish (yes) ambulance vehicle operating on the Syrian side.

## Thousands of refugees living in poor conditions

Even though the Syrian conflict is obvious from the Turkish side, entering Syria slapped my face: just after the 100 meters of the in-between road, you enter in a world of mess, mud, broken infrastructure and poor living conditions.

There are refugee camps on both sides of the border. While the Turkish camp seems to be made of solid houses, the Syrian one is only made of tents. It is located alongside the road, right after the custom offices. It welcomes, according to what I have been told, about 10,000 refugees. They mostly come from the neighboring region of Aleppo. The reason for their displacement is the constant risk of being bombarded by warplanes or SCUDs.

There are people who lost their home and all its content in the bombardments, meaning they have basically nothing left. The site is muddy and some children do not have proper shoes. Cold nights are probably hard in the tents, which were apparently brougth in by a private Syrian initiative (no international help). Food and water do not seem to be an issue. In short, conditions are just sufficient to physically survive.

[[!img images/P1130677.JPG alt="The camp: tents and mud" caption="The camp: tents and mud"]] [[!img images/P1130680_up.JPG alt="Children fetching drinking water from a tank" caption="Children fetching drinking water from a tank"]]

There is no real international help that reaches the Syrian camp, due to international laws. This also explains why camps inside Turkey are much better, as Turkey probably benefits from international help to build and maintain them. The Turkish-owned IHH organization is present in the Syrian camp.

Refugees either wait for a place in the Turkish camp or go back and forth to their hometown inside Syria. The bombardments push them to seek refuge in the camp, but its poor living conditions push them back to their hometown. Those seeking refuge in Turkey most probably do not have a valid passport or enough money to get a house, making them stuck until Turkey lets a batch of refugees in. Turkish camps are said to be full, and refugees can get in whenever there is some more room.

People's lifes in the camp are to a nearly complete halt. No work indeed, poor communication with outside, no infrastructure, i.e. not much that can fill their souls with hope. The world they have access to consists of a muddy camp with an unpassable border on one side and bombs falling on the other side. A good point however, some bigger tents are used as classrooms for children, to try to keep them mentally awake. I don't think there is enough "classrooms" for all children, though.

In overall, witnessing this was depressing and reminded me that while foreign people focus on so-called FSA victories, the real issue here where they could help is the suffering of these civilians.

## Chaotic FSA control from the border down to Aleppo

The area from Bab Assalameh down to Aleppo's outskirts is nearly completely out of regime control and will very likely stay so. This does however not mean that the FSA holds a firm grip all over the region, as it is quite a complex patchwork (as Syria is in general):

- some towns ([Azaz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azaz) and [Marea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mare%27) for example) are clearly opposed to the regime and are under FSA control;
- it is possible to circulate by car fairly securely in most of the region without meeting any regime checkpoint;
- a few spots are still under regime's army control, such as the military airbase of [Meng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minakh_Air_Base) (also written Minakh) south from Azaz;
- some other towns' populations are supportive to the regime, such as [Nubl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nubl);
- there are Kurdish towns like [Afrin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afrin,_Syria) and nearby villages which seem to be considered "unsure" as they are not strictly aligned with a side or another.

[[!img images/aleppo_region.png size=200x alt="Rough map of the area from Kilis down to Aleppo" caption="Rough map of the area from Kilis down to Aleppo"]]

In short, one can circulate quite safely in the area but the situation may vary a lot within a range of a couple of kilometers. Some neighboring towns even show opposed support and one can hear stories of kidnappings, massacres and reprisals in such areas. People with their cars are used to reach Aleppo from the Bab Assalameh border crossing. This also includes foreign journalists.

Spots knowingly supportive to the FSA are usual targets for regime's warplanes and SCUDs. Planes (old MiGs) seem to attack during daytime only and mostly by clear whether (possibly due to visibility issues), whereas SCUD attacks can happen anytime. The regime hasn't, until now, sent warplanes over the refugee camp.

The situation of Aleppo city and its outskirts is difficult to catch with precision. While it seems globally steady, zones of control inside the city fluctuate from a day to another.

The rough and incomplete map of the area displayed above shows regime's military presence in red, either due to permanent military bases or troops occupation. It is also available in [SVG format](https://words.ceops.eu/arabtrip/data/aleppo_region.svg) (4.2 MB) and [compressed SVG](https://words.ceops.eu/arabtrip/data/aleppo_region.svg.bz2) (492 KB). The map data and military bases come from OpenStreetMap, the contour (elevation) lines from [SRTM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuttle_Radar_Topography_Mission) and the army-occupied zones from information I gathered personally.

# Nusaybin-Qamishly: definitely not the same revolution

## Kurdistan's particular background

Nusaybin and Qamishly are in [Kurdistan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurdistan), and this is a key point to understand their [situation regarding the Syrian revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Syrian_Kurdistan_rebellion).

Kurds have a history of being subject to various forms of oppression from the countries' governments over which Kurdistan extends: Turkey, Syria and Iraq. This has probably increased solidarity between Kurds over the borders. They also have strong common cultural references, such as the Kurdish language. More generally, those national borders are quite a non-sense in regard to the Kurdish people and their history on this land.

Nusaybin and Qamishly are so close one to the other that they are virtually the same city split in two. To some extent, this reminded me of stories and scenes of the [Berlin wall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_wall).

From a Kurdish perspective, there are mixed necessities to resist at the same time from the oppression from Turkish and Syrian governments and from the threat that the FSA and other groups may represent. Hence, Kurdish groups seem generally not strictly aligned with one or the other side in the uprising, even though some groups can be considered as mostly allied with the regime (such as the PKK) and others mostly allied with the FSA (such as the Free Kurdish Army). The Kurdish position in the conflict is a third set of non-aligned movements with its peculiar considerations.

While I did not witness troubles (just a couple of happy rifle shootings for a wedding), the security policy of the Turkish authorities is a bit shocking. In Nusaybin, I did not see a single _standard_ police car: every single patroling car was an armored vehicle with mounted rifle gun, sometimes accompanied by an anti-riot water cannon equipped truck. Indeed, this participates in reminding people that there is some tension between Turks and Kurds.

## A peaceful situation at first glance

Nusaybin has a peaceful and normal daily life, as shops and caf√©s are open, streets are crowded, public transports work normally, etc.

The border crossing has been closed due to the conflict at least [since August 2012](https://westernkurdistan.wordpress.com/2013/02/16/the-kurdish-situation-in-syria-and-kurdistan/), other sources mentioning [early 2012](http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2110961,00.html) and even [late 2011](http://www.yalibnan.com/2011/10/09/syria-closes-a-border-crossing-with-turkey/). Possibly, there were moments when it was re-open, but it has probably been closed most of the time.

The ground has a very flat topology and, unlike Kilis which is a couple of kilometers away from the border, both Nusaybin's and Qamishly's urban areas extend up to as close as possible to the border fence. Hence, in Nusaybin town center people can walk along the fence and have an open view on Qamishly, only a couple of hundreds meters away.

The border zone, though featuring a military base and dozens of watch towers, is not very strictly guarded. It is usual to see shepherds leading their cattle in the quiet no man's land and children or young people playing football just behind the first fence, parts of it being broken. A military truck with a few of soldiers would intervene if some people have a behavior they don't like, and children would run off and come back five minutes later.

The regime's flag is floating on the Syrian side. There is no SCUD falling or warplanes bombing Qamishly. The destruction is in no way comparable to Aleppo's region. I did not notice any building of Qamishly that looked destroyed because of shelling.

Logically, there is no Syrian activity in Nusaybin like in Kilis. A few cars can be seen from time to time, but nothing comparable to Kilis. I saw one or two luxury cars being washed on the parking of a motel dedicated to trucks driver, on the side of a motorway passing near the town. 

People I met were not really keen on talking about Qamishly, even though most had friends or relatives there. The opinion about the Syrian uprising seems to be very suspicious that it is going to bring anything better, even though Assad does not seem to be particularly appreciated. The predominant feeling seems to be the fear of a degradation of the Kurds' condition as a result of the change in the ruling of Syria.

## Discrete traces of a peculiar conflict

In a shop, some young men buying beers asked me, laughing, "_what the hell are you doing here in this war?_", even before I mentioned Syria. Some others, smoking hashish near the border, asked me, laughing as well, if I was planning to go to Qamishly. Some older men told me they thougth that living conditions in Qamishly were very bad (no electricity, war, etc.) whereas some others told me that the conditions were OK and that the town was mostly peaceful. But I could not have any real in-depth conversation.

It is not easy to know if people are reluctant to have serious conversation because they lack information or because they want to avoid the topic, being fed up with years of unstability. It is also not easy to know if contradictory statements come from a lack of information as well or from a will to influence my vision of the situation.

During the day, some people wander around the border, on the phone with their friends or family and waving at them accross the no man's land. A couple I talked to near the border refused to be photographed, "_We are afraid, our family is in Qamishly_", they said. They had gone all the way from Qamishly to Bab Assalameh (an approximately 450km journey), had crossed into Kilis and then had gone all the way back on the Turkish side, from Kilis to Nusaybin. Some caf√©s near the border appear to be usual meeting points for some Syrians.

While the daytime life is very lively in town, all streets become empty very quickly as soon as the sun sets, and the darkness that everyone seems to flee appeared to me as an invitation for more underground, less noticeable activities.

There are probably events or movements that would need a closer look to be noticed. I know from trusted sources that PKK militants operate in Nusaybin and circulate to and from Qamishly. Other Kurd militants operate against PKK's actions, and all of this is related to the mixture of conflicts in the middle of which Kurds live, including the Syrian revolution.

Sneaking through the border is "_very easy_", from a couple of testimonies I had. It is, at least, possible for sure, as confirmed by [the story of this Italian photograph from last November](http://www.zona.org/en/appunti-siriani-nusaybin/). The absence of heavy patroling from Turks as well as the quite friendly ground also makes it more than likely, even though some reports indicate the presence of landmines in the no man's land.

While Qamishly seemed quiet, there are more open fights going on in areas nearby between various Kurd factions, the FSA and Assad's army.
The [battle of Ras al-Ayn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Ras_al-Ayn), located West from Qamishly, is a good example of this mixed conflicts between the three belligerants.

# Other regions of the border

There are indeed other bordering areas which have their particularities depending on many factors such as the level of violence on the Syrian side and the composition of the population on both sides:

- in [Cizre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cizre), located further East from Nusaybin, [at the border with both Iraq and Syria](http://www.openstreetmap.org/?lat=37.256&lon=42.287&zoom=11&layers=M), there seems to be even less traces of the Syrian uprising but more tensions between Turkish authorities and some of the Kurdish population; there is no major city or town on the Syrian side of the border;
- in [≈ûanlƒ±urfa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%9Eanl%C4%B1urfa), located roughly [halfway between Nusaybin and Gaziantep](http://www.openstreetmap.org/?lat=36.95&lon=39&zoom=8&layers=M), the population is mixed between Turks, Arabs and Kurds, and one can see displaced Syrian families in the streets and public transports; ≈ûanlƒ±urfa is the big city near the [Ak√ßakale](http://www.openstreetmap.org/?lat=36.874&lon=38.982&zoom=10&layers=M) refugee camp and border crossing;
- [Antakya and its region](http://www.openstreetmap.org/?lat=36.451&lon=36.468&zoom=9&layers=M) is known to have a high activity in relation to the Syrian uprising: it hosts several refugee camps along the border with people coming from both Idlib and Aleppo, but also has a local population that is in majority supportive of Assad's regime, and some of them are said to be cooperating with Assad's intelligence (_mukhabarat_).

# Conclusion

I hope that the reader will perceive how the Syrian revolution has many different faces, and how these faces can be noticed easily even by staying in bordering areas.

Whereas in the Western part with an Arab majority, near Aleppo and Idlib, the displacements and destruction are huge and the violence includes use of warplane bombings and SCUDs, the Eastern part, mostly Kurdish, has a very different ongoing conflict where fights seem to be essentially done on the ground, with smaller weapons and destructions.

I would encourage people who have been following the conflict from far away to go there by themselves if they are itching to do so. There is not much danger to fear in the areas I was, and seeing the situation and talking to people helps a lot in understanding. The areas are very easy to reach accross Turkey.

Further questions include mainly "_what can we do to help?_". This is a vast issue where answers range from giving money to training citizen journalists as well as giving clothes to civilians, tents, books for children, ... As there is hardly any doubt that foreign governments are truly willing to help anyone, action on a decentralized basis could help.
