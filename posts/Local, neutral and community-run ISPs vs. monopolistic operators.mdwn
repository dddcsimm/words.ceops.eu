The few major European telecom companies generally do not defend fundamental
rights on the Internet, as shown by their [opposition to network neutrality
enforcement](https://www.laquadrature.net/en/eu-parliament-negotiations-on-net-neutrality-taking-a-disastrous-turn)
and their lack of care regarding dark zones and the "[digital
divide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Divide)", as their investments
follow their profit scheme rather than seeking better Internet access for
everyone.

Some [local community-run initiatives](https://www.diyisp.org) aim at providing
citizens with neutral Internet access, including in dark zones and with rates
that are as reasonable as possible.

Unfortunately, the monopolisic situation of major telecom companies has a
chilling effect on such initiatives.

[Bram](http://worlddomination.be) and I held a workshop on this topic at
[Freedom Not Fear 2014 in
Brussels](https://wiki.vorratsdatenspeicherung.de/Freedom_Not_Fear_2014/Schedule):
how this chilling effect materializes in Europe and what EU-level changes we
could push to help the development of local and respectful ISP initiatives.

This is a (bit more than a) wrap-up of what was said. You can get the slides

# Local ISPs: missions and examples

## Missions

As explained in the [DIY ISP panel I
held](../DIY%20ISP%20panel%20at%20RightsCon%202014:%20wrap-up/) at
[RightsCon](https://www.rightscon.org/) 2014 in San Francisco, ISPs committed to
defend fundamental rights must respect network neutrality and users' privacy,
provide public IP addresses, enable users to be the decision-makers regarding
their Internet access and bring access to areas regardless of their
profitability.

Having as many such initiatives as possible is essential because it makes the
Internet more robust and harder to control for any single private or public
entity.

## Some local ISPs in Europe

### France and Belgium: French Data Network Federation (FFDN)

The first French non-profit ISP, [French Data Network](http://www.fdn.fr) (FDN)
was founded in 1992, when the market was new and easily accessible.

By the time DSL appeared, FDN had earned enough money to establish
[backhaul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backhaul_%28telecommunications%29)
contracts and enter this new market. It has been a DSL and dial-up provider
since then.

In 2010, it started encouraging local initiatives by allowing them to use its
countrywide backhaul contract while requiring them to respect [ethical
principles](http://www.ffdn.org/en/principles).

Many thus popped up, now forming the [FDN Federation](http://www.ffdn.org)
(FFDN). Most still only re-sell FDN DSL access but all aim at growing local
independant networks. At least, the human component is increasingly
decentralized and allows better local knowledge sharing, advocacy and
decision-making.

The Federation includes at the moment [26
operators](http://www.ffdn.org/en/members-ffdn) in France and Belgium. Some
bring connectivity to dark zones whereas others try to pierce through in the
urban zones market already saturated by major telecom companies.

I am a member of [Neutrinet](http://neutrinet.be) and
[FAImaison](https://faimaison.net), respectively operating in
[Belgium](https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/52411#map=7/50.552/4.702) and
the French regions of [Brittany](https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/102740)
and [Pays de la Loire](https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/8650).

### United Kingdom: rural community fiber networks (B4RN)

The United Kingdom has examples of community-run initiatives in rural dark
zones. The [B4RN](http://b4rn.org.uk) website has detailed examples of such
initiatives and how people can get involved.

In these areas, local inhabittants and public authorities gather to rent
equipment, dig trenches, lay a fiber network and enable high-speed connection
for the community.

It is unsure whether these operators are all committed to respecting network
neutrality but they address the dark zone issue, and the cooperation between
civil society and public authorities to fund and manage the structure can
probably be replicated in other areas.

# How the lack of free competition hamper citizens' right to Internet access

## Materialization of the problem

At the moment, bringing Internet access to people implies two main requirements:

- being connected to the big Internet pipes, for instance by having a
  [computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_system_(Internet)) racked
  in a [data center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center), connected to
  other operators' network and [making them aware of our
  existence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border_Gateway_Protocol);
- finding a way to connect users (who can be hundred of kilometers far from the
  data center) to this computer, as it will in turns allow them to access the
  Internet.

The second part is most often the hardest one, at least if the idea is to reach
people with high-speed wired connections (DSL, optical fiber). This is mostly
due to the monopolistic situations of formerly state-owned operators owning the
infrastructure and creating difficulties for small local operators to reach
end-users.

The European Union's free competition rules say that the infrastructure should
be accessible to any operator, the price for renting it being controlled by a
governmental body. Most often, the privatized and formerly state-owned
monopolistic operator (e.g.
[Orange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_S.A.),
[Belgacom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgacom), [Deutsche
Telekom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsche_Telekom)) still owns the
infrastructure but has to respect the renting price set by the governmental
body. This mechanism, also in use for the gas, electricity and train markets is
supposed to ensure free and fair competition.

In practice, the competition is often limited to a small set of big actors, as
local smaller players cannot afford to rent the infrastructure.

In this context, French FFDN operators are lucky to have FDN's DSL backhaul
contract. Those not in position to benefit from it have to fall back on using
wireless technology, which is cheap but less perennial.

Here are more specific examples from France and Belgium.

## France: the new but locked-down FTTH market

[FTTH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber_to_the_x) deployment in France is
managed at [regional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regions_of_France) and
[departmental](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Departments_of_France) level. Local
authorities are supposed to schedule its deployment for the next couple of years
in order to bring "very high-speed" Internet to all people.

Since they have neither enough money nor in-house capacity to do it themselves
entirely, they let major ISPs lay their own fiber in profitable areas (dense
urban zones). For areas where major ISPs do not feel like going, authorities pay
a private company to lay fiber and to rent it to potentially interested ISPs.

From the perspective of reaching as many people as possible with high-speed
Internet and choice of several operators, this system seems really broken:

- dense areas are served by only one or two of the major ISPs;
- in other areas, renting prices of the fiber infrastructure must be publicly
  available but the companies with which local authorities have contracted put
  strong efforts in not making their rates public;
- the rates are very expensive for small operators and there is no transparency
  on how these rates are set, although they are supposed to stem from a public
  decision;
- when negociating with companies, local authorities often do not manage to
  enforce real deployment of fiber optics all over the region and tend to let
  the company act along its own strategy while it should theoretically perform a
  public service mission, which results in poor or slow coverage of dark zones.

In short: no free competition to have local operators enter the FTTH market, and
very weak democratization of high-speed Internet access.

## Belgium: Belgacom's monopoly preventing competition on DSL market

Belgacom is the formerly state-owned operator. It is now a private company, but
more than half of its shares are owned by the state. Belgacom owns the whole
copper infrastructure in Belgium.

Establishing a DSL backhaul contract with Belgacom is extremely hard for several
reasons (while, again, the theory says that the market is open to free
competition):

- obtaining the price catalog in the first hand is a long and tiring process;
- the offers contain hidden additional prices and are hard to understand;
- rates are expensive.

The result is that any new ISP is completely discouraged from entering the DSL
market in Belgium. Additionally, there does not seem to be any strong will to
deploy FTTH in the country.

## Where we must not go: the example of the United States of America

The European situation looks contradictory: the free competition mechanism
should theoretically enable subscribers to choose among many different ISPs. We
however end up with a few monopolistic operators that impose huge barriers for
newcomers who could provide something really innovative in our times: be
technical intermediaries that are controlled by citizens and respectful of
fundamental rights.

This situation was maybe initially really meant to promote free competition. I
believe that this strategy is somewhat inspired from the American vision of
liberalism.

The issue is, the situation in the USA is worse: a set of three operators
(Verizon, AT&T and Comcast) controls most of the market, sometimes even agreeing
together to geographically split the market and avoid competing one with the
other.

They have a powerful lobby force and even manage to push local or federal laws
to hinder the growth of [local community-run
initiatives](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/07/hate-your-isp-maybe-you-need-community-fiber).

This absence of competition not only kills network neutrality and associated
fundamental rights but it also makes the prices increase and the service quality
stall.

# What we could do in Europe

First, the administrative fees to register as an operator vary within Europe. In
France, it is a free and purely declarative process to the regulatory body, the
[ARCEP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autorit%C3%A9_de_R%C3%A9gulation_des_Communications_%C3%89lectroniques_et_des_Postes).
The process is free in Germany too. In Belgium, it costs €300 per year, which
can be expensive for a really small association. We could push for **harmonizing
the operator registration process in Europe by making it easy and free of
charge** at least for small structures.

We also wondered whether **the operator status could be recognized EU-wise**, in
order to allow an operator that is registered in any EU country to operate in
any other EU country without further authorization. The
[BEREC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_of_European_Regulators_of_Electronic_Communications)
could be used as the regulatory body.

Another idea to ensure accessibility of the infrastructure is to **harmonize
backhaul offers throughout Europe** to force infrastructure managers to keep low
enough rates. Why not **give the BEREC the power to enforce reasonable rates and
fair competition throughout Europe**? This would not guarantee fair rates but
might be the start of a transparent management of the public Internet
infrastructure onto which European citizens could have their word. It was
mentioned during the workshop that the competition situation is Germany was
quite satisfactory as the authorities were efficiently preventing Deutsche
Telekom from raising the prices too highly.

To go a bit further, we could push for an actual complete split of the companies
that manage the infrastructure: they should not be at the same time
infrastructure manager and operator (by being DSL access providers,
for instance), as it creates a conflict of interest.

To accelerate fiber deployment, there could be ways to **encourage the laying of
pipes able to welcome fiber cables whenever trenches are dug along the roads**
or other infrastructure (e.g. railways). To some extent, this is already
practiced in some European cities.

More locally, some opportunities to lay fiber cable without having to do all the
digging work may appear, such as using waste water pipes or benefitting from
works on other infrastructure (roads, railways).

## We need to document ourselves more

These proposals are very drafty, and the exact European legal status regarding
free competition on the telecommunications market was not well known by the
participants of the workshop.

Yet, the [DIY ISP](https://www.diyisp.org) community should be able to make
these propositions more acurate and realistic and push them at the European
level in order to globally improve the conditions to setup local Internet access
providers.
